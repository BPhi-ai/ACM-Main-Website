				<div className="card"><h2>How to become an ACM Member</h2>
				The two steps to becoming a member are to first "Pay" and then "Sign-up". The steps are detailed below - please follow them to ensure a smooth transaction. Please note that there are NO REFUNDS and that membership DOES NOT guarantee project space.
				
				<h2>1. Payment</h2> The first step is to make the payment. There are two types ways to make a payment, choose what is most convient for you.
				<br></br>
				<i> 1-A. Cash Payments</i> Find the ACM Treasurer Geovanny Huerta (or set up a meeting via email: acm.calstatela@gmail.com) and once met with, give exact amount to him. He will give you a receipt. Take a picture of this receipt and proceed to the second step.
				<i> 1-B. Online Payments</i> Please make sure you have a working paypal account (i.e., can make payments). Pay with paypal by clicking the following button:
				<a href="https://www.paypal.com/checkoutnow?locale.x=en_US&fundingSource=paypal&sessionID=34fddf83ec_mti6mji6mdm&buttonSessionID=a0dd7194f3_mti6mji6mzc&env=production&fundingOffered=paypal&logLevel=warn&sdkMeta=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXlwYWxvYmplY3RzLmNvbS9hcGkvY2hlY2tvdXQuanMifQ%3D%3D&uid=fee22108f3&version=4&token=EC-74H47305T0781223K&xcomponent=1#/checkout/login" class="btn btn-info" role="button">Pay with Paypal</a>
				Once finished, take a screenshot of your paypal receipt. You can either take a screenshot of the confirmation email OR your transaction history - whatever proves that you have made the purchase. 
				<br></br>
				<br></br><br></br>

				<h2>2. Fill out the Membership Registration Form</h2>
				Once you're finished making the payment, please fill out the Google Form with your information (button below). In the very bottom, you will be asked to provide a proof of payment. Please attach the screenshot of either your cash receipt (from the treasurer) or the paypal screenshot.

				<h2>3. Additional steps</h2>
